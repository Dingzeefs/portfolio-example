You should be able to fit one Front/Back and one Side template onto the first third of the dough rolled out. Remove the scrap pieces and set aside in the bowl with the remaining dough to keep it warm. Without moving the cut gingerbread pieces, slide the parchment paper with cut pieces adhered to it onto a baking sheet. If you would like to add windows or doors, now is the time to do so. Cut out the shapes of the windows and doors, but do not remove the dough to make holes. The key here is to score the dough and remove the dough after baking to make the most even window shapes. Bake for 13 minutes.', 'Repeat with the remaining dough, dividing it in half, and cut another Front/Back and Side pieces. The last piece of dough will fit two roof shapes. Have these cut and ready to go on parchment paper.', 'When the first batch of gingerbread house pieces are removed from the oven, allow it to cool for 1-2 minutes. Then use a paring knife to cut along the score lines for the windows and doors. Remove the dough. Allow the pieces to cool completely. Repeat baking off the remaining pieces.', 'There will be some dough remaining after all the house pieces are cut. Roll this out and cut out gingerbread people and trees using 1 ½” sized cutters.', 'Once all the pieces have cooled completely, crush the green apple hard candy into very fine pieces. Fill the windows with the candy and bake at 350 F for 4 minutes or until the crushed candy has melted. Allow to cool again until hardened before assembling the house.', 'While the pieces are cooling, whip the gingerbread mortar in a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment until it loses shine, about 7-10 minutes. Divide the mortar into three sections, by placing some icing onto a piece of plastic wrap. Roll the plastic wrap around the icing and twist the ends. This will keep the icing soft and piping bags clean. When you are ready to use the icing, cut off one of the twisted ends and place it cut side down into a piping bag fitted with the appropriate piping tip.', 'If you want the sturdiest possible gingerbread house, use a pocket plane to file the edges straight. You can skip this step just use more mortar. Using a large piping bag fitted with an Ateco 802 tip, pipe mortar on the bottom and side of the first Side piece. Attach it to one Front/Back piece. Set two cans on either side of the side piece to hold it up while the mortar dries. Repeat by attaching the remaining sides.', 'Pipe around the top edges and adhere the roof pieces.', 'Ta da! The entire house is assembled and ready to be decorated any way you would like using the mortar as glue for the candies. Round matcha candies for the roof, Pocky icicles, wafer sidewalks, mochi bushes, coconut snow...the possibilities are endless. The smaller round piping tips are used to add finer details and to attach the candies. The larger round piping tip was best used to attach candies to the roof.']}
