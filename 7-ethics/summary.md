# Ethical Assignments:

## Assignment 1: Ethical Frameworks in Data Science

**File:** `Portfolio assignment 1 - Liam van Vliet - Ethics MADS.pdf`

Compares **Deontological Ethics** vs **Virtue Ethics** for data science applications. The assignment examines how deontology focuses on universal duties and rules (fairness, transparency, privacy) while virtue ethics emphasizes cultivating moral character traits (honesty, integrity, care). Concludes that deontology provides a stronger foundation for data ethics because it offers clear, enforceable rules that can be translated into laws and technical safeguards.

## Assignment 2: Algorithmic Bias in Dating Apps

**File:** `Liam_van_Vliet-Ethics_assignment2 (1).pdf`

Analyzes algorithmic discrimination in a fictional dating app called "Breeze," where users with darker skin tones or non-Dutch backgrounds receive fewer matches. Uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to illustrate how bias flows from user preferences through the algorithm to match outcomes, with feedback loops that amplify discrimination over time. Recommends using causal diagrams for bias detection, privacy-friendly auditing methods, and regular monitoring to prevent bias amplification.
