# Hyperparameter Tuning Report: Fashion-MNIST Neural Network Optimization

## Objective
Systematically optimize a feedforward neural network for Fashion-MNIST classification through controlled hyperparameter experiments.

## Methodology
Five hypothesis-driven experiments testing width, depth, epochs, batch size, and extended capacity using 60,000 training samples across 10 clothing categories.

## Key Findings

### 1. Network Width Effects
**Hypothesis**: "Balanced layer sizes (units1 â‰ˆ units2) will outperform unbalanced configurations"
- **Result**: Confirmed. 128-128 (87.67%) outperformed most unbalanced combinations
- **Sweet spot**: 256-256 achieved optimal accuracy (88.03%) with reasonable computational cost

### 2. Training Duration Impact
**Hypothesis**: "256-256 will outperform 128-128 given sufficient epochs"
- **Result**: Partially confirmed. 256-256 won by 0.06% at 10 epochs, but 128-128 showed faster convergence
- **Insight**: Models plateau at 87-88% accuracy regardless of size

### 3. Network Depth Analysis
**Hypothesis**: "3-layer networks will underperform due to vanishing gradients"
- **Result**: Disproven. 3-layer networks slightly outperformed 2-layer (0.09-0.12% gain)
- **Trade-off**: Minimal accuracy improvement vs 14-25% more parameters

### 4. Extended Capacity Testing
**Hypothesis**: "Networks beyond 512 units will show diminishing returns"
- **Result**: Confirmed. 1024-1024 achieved highest accuracy (88.35%) but at 7x parameter cost for only +0.32% gain

### 5. Batch Size Optimization
**Hypothesis**: "Smaller batches provide implicit regularization for large networks"
- **Result**: Confirmed. Batch size 32 optimal (87.95%), balancing gradient stability with regularization

## Recommendations

### Production Deployment: 256-256 Architecture
- **Accuracy**: 88.03%
- **Parameters**: 269,322
- **Training time**: 22.1s
- **Rationale**: Best accuracy-efficiency balance

### Resource-Constrained Environments: 128-128 Architecture
- **Accuracy**: 87.67% (99.6% of optimal)
- **Parameters**: 118,282 (44% fewer)
- **Training time**: 13.4s (39% faster)

### Configuration Settings
- **Epochs**: 10 (convergence point)
- **Batch size**: 32-64 (optimal range)
- **Depth**: 2-3 layers (minimal difference)
- **Optimizer**: Adam with lr=0.001

## Scientific Insights

1. **Fashion-MNIST complexity ceiling**: Dataset reaches performance plateau around 88%, suggesting inherent classification difficulty
2. **Parameter efficiency matters**: 128-128 achieves 99.6% of optimal performance with 56% fewer parameters
3. **Depth vs width trade-off**: Width provides better accuracy gains than depth for this dataset
4. **Batch size sweet spot**: Balance between gradient noise (regularization) and stability crucial

## Conclusion
Systematic hyperparameter tuning revealed that Fashion-MNIST classification benefits more from moderate network width than extreme depth or capacity. The 256-256 configuration represents the practical optimum, while 128-128 offers excellent efficiency for resource-constrained scenarios.
